## 1. Steampunk Visual Philosophy

### Core Design Principles
- **Mechanical Beauty**: Expose the inner workings - gears, pistons, steam pipes
- **Victorian Elegance**: Ornate details, brass flourishes, leather accents
- **Industrial Grit**: Rust, oil stains, weathering, and patina
- **Retrofuturism**: Impossible steam-powered technology with period-appropriate materials
- **Craftsmanship**: Hand-forged appearance, visible rivets, custom engravings

### Visual Themes
1. **"Form Follows Function"** - Every decorative element should appear functional
2. **"Beautiful Decay"** - Weathering and aging add character
3. **"Exposed Mechanics"** - Internal mechanisms as external beauty
4. **"Brass and Steam"** - The golden age of engineering made visible
